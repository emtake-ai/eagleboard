This section provides information about deep learning models.  

We present the following models that represent the historical evolution of deep learning architectures:  

LeNet  
AlexNet  
VGGNet  
GoogLeNet  
ResNet  
MobileNet  
EfficientNet  

On GitHub, you can review the dataflow graphs and detailed model information in this directory.  
For more comprehensive resources, please refer to Hugging Face. you can get the model which trained.
