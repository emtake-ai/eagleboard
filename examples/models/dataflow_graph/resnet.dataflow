dataflow graph operator and shape

✅ 1. ResNet High-Level Pipeline (common to all variants)
Input 224×224
→ Conv1 (7×7)
→ MaxPool
→ Stage 1 (Res2_x)
→ Stage 2 (Res3_x)
→ Stage 3 (Res4_x)
→ Stage 4 (Res5_x)
→ GlobalAvgPool
→ FC (1000)

✅ 2. ResNet-18 / ResNet-34 (BasicBlock)

BasicBlock structure:

Input → Conv3×3 → BN → ReLU → Conv3×3 → BN
       + Skip Connection
       → ReLU

⭐ ResNet-18 Exact Shapes

Input: (3,224,224)

Conv1
7×7, stride=2 → (64,112,112)
MaxPool 3×3 s=2 → (64,56,56)

Stage 1: Res2_x (2 blocks)

Output shape: (64,56,56)

Stage 2: Res3_x (2 blocks)

First block stride=2
Output shape: (128,28,28)

Stage 3: Res4_x (2 blocks)

Output: (256,14,14)

Stage 4: Res5_x (2 blocks)

Output: (512,7,7)

GAP → FC → 1000

Final: (1000)
