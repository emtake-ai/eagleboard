This folder provides the main entry points for the documentation in`deployment/`, `hardware/`, `model_conversion/`, and `npu`.  
Each subdirectory contains its own README with detailed instructions.  


The documentation is organized as follows.

The `deployment` section explains how to execute `.lne` models from Python using the EagleBoard runtime.

The `hardware` section describes the EagleBoard hardware specifications, including board architecture, interfaces, and system resources.

The `model_conversion` section provides detailed instructions on how to convert trained AI models into NPU-compatible formats, covering the entire conversion pipeline.

The `npu` section documents the NPU specifications, including architecture, supported operators, performance characteristics, and internal processing flow.
